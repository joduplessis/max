# Max

Bot example using NodeJS, Microsoft's BotBuilder framework, Microsoft's LUIS service (for natural language processing) & Google's Vision API (for identifying images). Deployable to Slack, Skype, Messenger, etc.

## Notes

You can ask Max to store username & password details, identify images, shop for images & tell you jokes. The main driver of this is to provide people with a working example of tying various other services together. You need to ask it for a "Warren joke" (friend) for the joke.
